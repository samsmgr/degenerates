		<p id = "maintext" style = "vertical-align: top;">Antonio Bellavicini was a bartender working in the saloon at 32 Sands St., a hotel located on the infamous <i>Sands Street</i> known for its gay cruising and general lawlessness. During his shift one night, he was drawn into a raid enacted by a disguised police officer and was arrested -- not for soliciting the undercover officer, as the other five were -- but simply for being there for that solicitation, and (as the courts argued) implicitly allowing homosexual activity to take place.<br><br>
		
		Above is the appeal made by Bellavicini in an attempt to overturn his conviction and sentencing (which was to three months in the workhouse). This attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, as the court ruled 3-2 that his conviction would stand. What he was convicted for was violation of §1146 of the Penal Law: "<i>Whosoever shall keep or maintain a house of ill-fame or assignation of any description or a place for the encouragement or practice by persons of lewdness, fornication, unlawful sexual intercourse or for any other indecent or disorderly act or obscene purpose therein or any place of public resort at which the decency, peace or comfort of a neighborhood is disturbed, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</i>" Essentially, having run a disorderly establishment that housed lewd individuals and disturbed the decency of the neighborhood was a prosecutable offense.<br><br>
		
		Bellavicini's defense did not concern the actual actions of the <i>lewd persons</i> at 32 Sands St., but rather that no matter their actions, they had not reached any level where he could reasonably have been expected to notice or take action. The presiding Justice's response? "But he had eyes and could see."<br><br>
		
		However, while it was homosexuals that the NYPD was interested in policing, the language of the law wasn't quite there. "<i>The problem was this: As 'homosexuals' were beginning to be understood as a deviant class, their very existence needed to be policed. But laws like disorderly conduct were designed to be brought to bear against activities, not identities. This was why the police made such a big deal about powder puffs and make-up: Because wearing clothing of the 'opposite' gender was an illegal, arrest-able activity.</i>" (Hugh Ryan, Inventing, and Policing, the Homosexual in Early 20th c. NYC) There were certainly laws against degeneracy -- but what of the <b>degenerates</b>?

	<p id = "maintext">In 1933, following the full repeal of Prohibition and the passage of the 21st Amendment, each state was left to navigate the uncertain waters of legal alcohol on its own. Shortly following the end of Prohibition, New York State passed the Alcohol Beverage Control Law and formed the State Liquor Authority, which was tasked with the regulation, rules, and enforcements of liquor licenses accross the state. With that newfound authority, the SLA used its power to persecute and shut down gay bars (or even bars where it was suspected that homosexual activities had taken place) for the next few decades under a 'disorderly conduct' provision remarkably similar to New York's 1923 disorderly conduct laws. An establishment's liquor license could be revoked if it was found to be running a 'disorderly house' - and there was nothing more disorderly to the SLA than a gathering of homosexuals.</p>
	
	<p id = "law"><b>F & C Holding Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority</b><br><br>
		... Patrolman Stephen C. Chapwick, of the 4th Precinct, was assigned to plainclothes duty on the evening of November 12, 1965 when he entered the licensed premises known as Julius' Restaurant at 159 West 10th Street, Greenwich Village at 11:10 PM. There were about seventy-five to eighty people in the premises (44). There were about thirty males at the bar; seated at the tables in the rear of the premises were about ten females, with the remainder of the patrons being male. Of those males at the bar, Officer Chapwick observed about six who spoke in high, shrill voices, wore tight clothes and exhibited limp wrists. They were calling each other "honey" and "deary" (45). These latter patrons walked in a mincing gait, wiggling their hips as they walked to the juke box or to the rear of the premises (45); they walked with cigarettes in their hands in an effeminate manner, "waiving (sic) their wrists very loosely and limply" (46)...<br><br></p>

	<div id = "col2">
		<p id = "maintext" style = "margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 20%; margin-top: 0;">Julius' (here arraigned) was a longstanding and popular Greenwich Village gay bar, as much as any gay bars in the 60s could have been considered 'popular'. Notable in the history of gay rights, only six months after the incident described in this court case, it would be the site of a 'Sip-In'. This was a protest organized in 1966 by the Mattachine Society, in which they went to several bars and restaurants to attempt ordering drinks after making it clear that they were gay. On the left is a picture taken at that Sip-In -- the bartender covering the mens' glasses, unwilling to serve public homosexuals following a recent police raid.<br><br>
		"Public" was the key word here: the illegal homosexual was the public one, the one who was not only engaging in deviance but visibly deviant himself. In his testimony Patrolman Chapwick describes men with shrill voices, limp wrists, and mincing walks: gender non-conformity is, here, an affront to the public space. The question that the SLA and NYPD wrestled with was <i>what exactly constitutes the (prosecutable) homosexual?</i> Was it his actions [of sexual deviance]? His very being [as a sexual deviant]?<br><br>
		This was especially important when it came to the liability of the establishment itself for allowing disorderly (homosexual) conduct.

	<p id = "caption" style = "color:gray;">refusal of service at julius' bar. fred mcdarrah (getty images), 1966.</p>
	
	<p id = "maintext">Was the bartender, for instance, legally liable for permitting disorderly conduct if he served a drink to a closeted man? What if that man was instead a queen, and the bartender simply unobservant? How mincing did his walk have to be and how limp his wrists before he should be denied service?</p>
	
	<p id = "law">
		...He [Chapwick] admitted that he did not see any overt acts of homosexuality, such as touching of private parts, performed by those persons whom he had described as having limp wrists and walking in a minceful gait (52)...<br><br>
		...In response to questioning by the hearing officer, Patrolman Chapwick stated that he had been in other bars before, and that in his opinion, there were "fags" at the bar in Julius', although the appearance of the fags in Julius' was a little different than those in other bars (60)...<br><br>
		...Lohmeyer [an employee of Julius'] further testified that he would not serve a homosexual if he knew a person to be one, but he could not determine if the person was a homosexual (72)...<br>
	</p>
	
	<p id = "maintext">Here, Patrolman Chapwick admits on the record that he did not see any men <i>performing homosexuality</i>. Rather, he saw <i>homosexuals</i> -- and that was enough. Disorderly conduct had transformed from overt homosexuality at bars to an act of being: the homosexual himself was by nature a disorder. The very suspicion that a man liked men was enough to transform him from a citizen into a disorderly being, but the question remained of where exactly to draw the line. As seen in the following case (Beeshos v. SLA), there was also a certain reciprocal nature of the relationship between homosexuality and the homosexual: the behavior, in courts of law, in turn also created the expression.</p>
	
	<p id = "law"><b>The Beeshos Restaurant, Inc. v. New York State Liquor Authority</b><br><br>
		...Bradley observed "approximately 40 to 50" male patrons in the premises (31). About "ten to 15 of them were wearing pancake makeup, eyebrow pencil and mascara and perfume ... They were all dressed in tight pants, bulky knit sweaters and velour shirts. Many of the patrons had effeminate characteristics, such as short mincing steps ... limp wrists ... effeminate speech (32)...<br><br>
		... Bradley testified that the man at the door approached him as he was talking to Campanaro, and said, "I see you met the queen of the place ... Don't worry. You will have a good time with him" (31).<br>
		&emsp;A little later, "suddenly all the lights in the premises went on", and the "man at the door ... came over to us", and warned them against talking to strangers because "there were cops in the place" (28). Bradley observed police officers in the premises (29). After about 30 to 45 minutes, "the plainclothesmen left and they turned the lights back down again" (28)...<br></p>
		
	<p id = "maintext">The case of Beeshos v. SLA is a similar story to the previous case of Julius' (unsurprising, as the SLA hardly had to switch up their tactics to enjoy great success in closing bars following police raids). A plainclothes officer entered Beeshos Restaurant, and sat at the bar where he made the aquaintance of William Campanaro, a (gay) patron of Beeshos. According to Officer Bradley, following some conversation, <i>"[Campanaro] asked me if I had an apartment in the city which I replied that I did. He stated to me he lived in the Y.M.C.A., I believe, on 67th Street. He also stated to me that he would like to go to my apartment with me and spend the remainder of the night where we would have sex and anything else we wanted. I stated, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'Don't worry. Anything you want. I will suck your cock and fuck you in the ass.' I agreed. I said, 'Let's have one more drink before we leave,' not wanting to arouse any suspicion or anything."</i> Afterwards, Officer Bradley left with Campanaro and walked one block south, at which time he identified himself as a police officer and placed Campanaro under arrest.<p>
	<div id = "col2"><p id = "maintext" style = "margin-left: 1%; margin-top: 0;">The 'signs of homosexuality' that Officer Bradley noticed in the men of Beeshos materialized following Campanaro's solicitation: suddenly, every man in there could be seen to droop his wrists as he walked, to be wearing 'pancake makeup' and to smell of women's perfumes. Witnesses testified that no such behaviors had been exhibited - but gender nonconformity itself had become a legal borderland through which law and prosecution was understood for gay communities.<br><br>
	
	On the one hand, if an individual seemed queer enough to the untrained eye, that visible deviance in turn created the assumption of homosexual actions; on the other, homosexual actions (or intent to commit) created a palpable aura, a visible difference that could transform a man from closeted and unclockable to a "fairy." Suspicion was just as damning as conviction.</p></div>
		
	<div id = "col1"><p id = "law" style = "margin-right: 1%; margin-left: 30%;">
		... <i>Cross-examination of Police Officer Bradley</i> disclosed no discrepancies in his original testimony, and disclosed the following additional facts: That Campanaro "had pancake makeup on and perfume on" (47); that "when Campanaro got up to go to the bathroom, he walked into the ladies room" (39)...<br><br>
		...<i> Camille Quintiliani</i> testified that she is secretary of the licensee corporation (118) ... that she did not see any patron wearing makeup, mascara or perfume, nor did she see patrons using mincing steps, limp wrists or effeminate voices (124)...<br><br>
		...<i> Arthur Sanders</i> testified that he was the bartender on duty February 3, 1966 ... that he did not see male patrons wearing mascara, makeup or perfume, nor were they using mincing steps, limp wrists (109), or effeminate voices...<br><br>
